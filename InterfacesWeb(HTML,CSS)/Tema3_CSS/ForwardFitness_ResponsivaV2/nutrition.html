              <p>
                Good nutrition is the key to good mental and physical health.
                Eating a balanced diet is an important part of good health for
                everyone. The kind and amount of food you eat affects the way
                you feel and how your body works.

              <h2>What to Eat</h2>
              <img src="images/comida.jpg" alt="What to Eat" />
              <p>Use the guideline:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Protein</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li>Fruits</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We recommend eating mostly vegetables, fruit, and whole grains,
                healthy fats, and healthy proteins. We suggest drinking water
                instead of sugary beverages, and we also address common dietary
                concerns such as salt and sodium, vitamins, and alcohol.
